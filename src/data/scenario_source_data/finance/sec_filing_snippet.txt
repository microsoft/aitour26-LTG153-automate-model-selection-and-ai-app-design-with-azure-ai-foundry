*Risks Related to our Business and Industry*

Our success depends on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology, including the Auracoreâ„¢ Fiber technology. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our brand and competitive position.

*Risks Related to Data Privacy*

Our products, particularly those in the smart home and healthcare sectors, may collect and store sensitive user data. A failure to comply with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, or a data breach, could result in significant fines, reputational damage, and a loss of customer trust. Our current disclosures on data retention policies in section 4.2 may not be sufficiently detailed to meet evolving regulatory standards.

*Risks Related to Litigation*

We are currently in discussions with a former partner regarding the dissolution of a prior agreement. While we believe the matter will be resolved without material impact, the outcome is uncertain. This is noted in section 4.2.
